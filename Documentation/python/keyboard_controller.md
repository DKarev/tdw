## `KeyboardController(Controller)`

`from tdw.keyboard_controller import KeyboardController`

Listen for keyboard input to send commands.

Usage:

```python
from tdw.keyboard_controller import KeyboardController
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

def stop():
    done = True

done = False
c = KeyboardController()
c.start()

# Quit.
c.listen(key="esc", commands=None, function=stop)

# Equivalent to c.start()
c.listen(key="r", commands={"$type": "load_scene", "scene_name": "ProcGenScene"}, function=None)

while not done:
    # Receive data. Load the scene when r is pressed. Quit when Esc is pressed.
    c.communicate([])
# Stop the build.
c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
```

Create the network socket and bind the socket to the port.
